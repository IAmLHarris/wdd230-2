        The Fresh page contains a form that allows the user to build a specialty
        drink. The form requires the following items: first name, email, phone,
        three (3) select inputs that are populated with the available fruit to
        put into a drink. Available fruit options must only come from this JSON
        data source: FRUIT Links to an external site. for full credit
        consideration. and, include an area that allows them to add special
        instructions if needed. Do NOT send the form to a new page upon form
        submission. Instead, use a JavaScript event handler to produce a
        formatted output area on this same page showing: the input values of the
        order (7 inputs = first name, email, phone, three selected fruits, and
        special instructions), the order date, and the total amount of
        carbohydrates, protein, fat, sugar, and calories based upon the three
        fruit choices selected on the form. Again, use the JSON fruit data to
        extract and sum up that information.
